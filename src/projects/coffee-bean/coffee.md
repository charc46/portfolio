**The coffee Bean website is a Gatsby site for a fictional London coffee shop.**

I wanted to become more familiar with Gatsby as I think it's a great framework for creating simple websites such as this.

The site is hosted on Netlify and uses Mapbox for the map on the home page.

## Technologies used:
* Javascript
* Gatsby
* React
* Sass
