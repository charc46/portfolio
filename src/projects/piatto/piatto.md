**Piatto is a social dish discovery platform designed to enable users to find and enjoy new dishes based on their taste and that of their social network.**

Piatto was built by myself and a team of 3 others as our final project for Le Wagon coding bootcamp at the end of 2020.
We had 10 days to design, plan and build our project to then present to our fellow students and teachers on demo day at the end of our course.

We imagined Piatto as a sort of Spotify for takeaway dishes, where you can create your own 'dishlists' rather than playlists. This allows you to group together your favourite takeaway dishes for your friends to look through or simply as a reference for yourself.
Piatto takes your location in to account when you search for a dish or restaurant and suggests other similar meals nearby if the one you are looking at isn't available near you.
