**MyBrary is an online book repository for your personal book collection!**

---

As a bit of a bookworm I wanted to create an app for keeping track of my book collection at home, so I made MyBrary.

MyBrary is a Rails app which utilises the google books api to allow users to search for a book and add it to their collection.
There is a dashboard feature which gives you information on your book collection such as most popular authors/genres.

Users can also find and follow friends and look at their book collections to add a social aspect to the app.

## Technologies used:
* Ruby on Rails
* HTML
* CSS/Sass
* PostgreSQL
* Hosted on Heroku
