**My online portfolio to show the world a few of my projects and for them to get to know a little more about me.**

---

I started learning React in 2021 and soon after discovered Gatsby which I chose to build my portfolio with.
I decided to use Gatsby for my portfolio as it is React based and I wanted to implement my learnings as well as creating a new portfolio.

I used several gatsby plugins for my portfolio to allow me to render these project pages from markdown as well as use Sass for styling.

## Technologies used:
* Gatsby
* React
* Javascript
* Sass
* Markdown
* GraphQL
* Hosted on Netlify
