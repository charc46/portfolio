**A place to remember all of your favourite quotes.**

---

I like to read a fair bit in my spare time and I often come across a gem of a quote from some wise old timer.. then I forget it.

So I thought I would put together this little app to help remind me of them, I have it set as my new tab page on my browser so each time I open a new tab I get reminded of something I probably forgot!

The app is built with a node backend and a react front end using redux.

## Technologies used:
* React
* Redux
* Node.js
* Express
* Sass
* Hosted on Heroku
