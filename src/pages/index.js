        <p>After travelling the world working on Private Yachts I started to teach myself to code during 2019 and quickly discovered I had a real passion for it.<br /> 
        Being able to have an idea and watch it come together as I build it was a feeling I had never experienced before.</p>

        <p>I decided to attend a bootcamp in London at the end of 2020 to give my learning a boost and meet other like-minded people!</p>

        <p>Thanks to my learning and projects completed during the bootcamp I have experience with Ruby on Rails. HTML, CSS/Sass, PostgreSQL, deploying to Heroku and using git and Github in a remote, team based workflow.</p>

        <p>I have recently been working more with Javascript and React and have been delving further into full stack development with Javascript.</p>

        <p>I love food.<br/> I love coffee.<br/> I love to travel.<br/> And of course I love all things techy.</p>
